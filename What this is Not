This document is to state simply, what this application could be, but isn't. It won't cover everything, just things that
one might expect.

What this is NOT:

  * A character generator.
  * A mapping tool.
  
What this will never do:

  * Social network intergration.
  * Generalised file transfers: while it will allow streaming of sound and/or video, and will transfer character sheets 
    and images back and forth, it won't be very useful as a file transfer utility, and does not have to.
  * Utilise a web interface for basic functionality.
  
  
While the list above is not expansive, it should give someone a clearer picture of what I'm NOT trying to do here.
